# Quiz

This timed quiz takes an array with answers and allows response to questions while tallying scores.  Once quiz is finished, High Scores are stored and kept, with the option of playing again or clearing the high scores.

This uses arrays for the main logic along with 2 HTML pages and some CSS Styling.
